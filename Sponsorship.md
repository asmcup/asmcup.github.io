# Assembly Cup Sponsorship

This contains information about sponsoring the Assembly Cup, which is a "4k" contest where small autonomous robots are programmed by players and placed into a virtual world to compete over prizes. The target audience are programmers, gamers, and technology enthusiasts.

Starting December players will be given 45 days to register their robots. After all submissions are collected the robots are placed into a game world and a replay is generated. Players and fans can spectate the game by watching the replay on the homepage with a leaderboard that shows which robot is doing the best.

Contestants are paid out based on their in-game performance of collecting gold items. If the full funding goal of $1,000 is acheived then a player collecting every piece of gold would earn all $1,000. If two players competed and collected the same amount of gold they would be awarded $500 each. Funds will be held in escrow by the organizer who cannot compete in the contest itself. 

**All sponsors must be family friendly!**

Cost | Limit | Description
-----|-------|-------------
$500 | 1     | Contest name and in-game gold are branded by your company
$50  | 10    | Logo with link is shown on front page
 -   | -     | Prizes award to top N contestants

## Main Sponsor

The main sponsor may:

* Name the contest featuring your brand (i.e: "RedBull Robot Fight")
* Change the in-game "gold" item to match your brand (i.e: cans of RedBull instead of piles of gold)

Considerable leeway is given to the sponsor, but it must remain family friendly and cannot be misleading. Your logo will be placed as the first thing in the contest homepage and page title. Players and spectators will see your brand name everytime they are looking at the total amount of "gold" collected.

## Additional Sponsors

Sponsoring $50 or more will get your logo placed on the front page of the competition near the middle of the page. You need to submit to us a high-contrast PNG file and tell us where the link click should go to. Position of the logo will be sorted by sponsorship amount.


## Non-Monetary Prizes

You can submit prizes like free subscriptions, credit to your services, digital goods and physical goods. Sponsors who submit non-monetary prizes will have their brand listed in the rewards section which is primarily geared towards contestants.
